This Controller let you controll all settings of your SoyoSource inverter and can control it for zero grid injection.   
The Software is based on ESP-home and the great work of [syssi](https://github.com/syssi).    
You can find the sources at [github](https://github.com/syssi/esphome-soyosource-gtn-virtual-meter).   
It is based on this [template](https://github.com/syssi/esphome-soyosource-gtn-virtual-meter/blob/main/esp8266-display-display-version-limiter-example.yaml).   

All you have to do is to change the PIN definition:
```
tx_pin_ttl_wifi: GPIO12
rx_pin_ttl_wifi: GPIO13
tx_pin_rs485: GPIO16
rx_pin_rs485: GPIO5
```

And add these lines to activate the status LED:
```
status_led:
  pin: GPIO2
```
    
## external Controller 
in din rail case. needs another adapter cable in the inverter. this adapter cable adds an external connector for the display port.

## interal Controller
just take the RS485 board out and plug this in.    
Connect the display port to the board and add the external antenna.

You can find the gerber files in the directory external or internal.
